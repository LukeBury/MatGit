%% Acquire GPS Data from Your Apple(R) iOS Device and Plot Your Location and Speed on a Map
%
% This example shows how to collect position data from an Apple iOS device 
% and display it on a map. Latitude and longitude coordinates are used to 
% mark the device's route. Speed information is used to add color to the 
% route. The final result is a visual representation of location and speed 
% for the device's journey. 
% 
% This example requires Mapping Toolbox(TM).

%% Setting up the connection to your mobile device
% In order to receive data from an Apple iOS device in MATLAB(R), you will 
% need the MATLAB Mobile(TM) app (version 2.0). You can download this app 
% from App Store(SM).

%% 
% Use MATLAB Connector to allow connection between your desktop MATLAB 
% session and MATLAB Mobile on your Apple iOS device. Your device must be 
% able to connect to your desktop, either by being on the same network, 
% using a VPN, or through a similar configuration. 
%
% In this example, a VPN was used on the device to maintain a connection to
% the network while driving.
%
% Execute the |connector| command with a password of your choice.

connector on yourpassword;

%%
% Your computer's DNS name and IP address are displayed on
% the MATLAB Command Window, along with a test link. Click on the test link
% to ensure that your desktop is ready to connect. The last digits after
% the colon on the test link correspond to the port that has been opened.

%% 
% Now you can connect MATLAB Mobile to your desktop.
%
% If you are launching MATLAB Mobile for the first time, select Connect to 
% Your Computer. If you previously connected to the cloud or a different 
% desktop, go to the Settings screen and select Add a Computer from the 
% Connect to Your Computers section.
% On the Add a Computer screen, enter the DNS name or IP address that was
% displayed in the previous step. Then, enter the Connector password that 
% you previously specified, as well as the port that was opened.
% Finally, press the Connect button.
% MATLAB Mobile should now be connected to your desktop MATLAB session.

%% Create a link to your mobile device
% Use the |mobiledev| command to create an object that represents your
% mobile device.

m = mobiledev

%%
% The displayed output should show |Connected: 1|, indicating that the 
% |mobiledev| object has successfully established a connection to the app.

%% Prepare for data acquisition from the position sensor
% In order to collect GPS data, first ensure that your device's GPS is 
% turned on. If enabled on an Apple iOS device's location settings, mobile 
% networks and Wi-Fi can also be used to determine position.
%
% Enable the position sensor on your mobile device.

m.PositionSensorEnabled = 1;

%%
% It may take some time for data to appear on the Sensors screen of MATLAB 
% Mobile, as the device will need to search for a GPS signal. GPS signals 
% are generally unavailable indoors.

%% Start acquiring data
% After enabling the sensors, the Sensors screen of MATLAB Mobile will show
% the current data measured by the sensors. The |Logging| property allows 
% you to begin sending sensor data to |mobiledev|.

m.Logging = 1;

%% Gather position data 
% All position sensor data recorded on the device is now being logged by 
% |mobiledev|. 
% 
% In this example, the device was taken on a short drive around MathWorks(R).

%% Stop logging data
% Use |mobiledev|'s logging property again to stop logging data. 

m.Logging = 0;

%% Retrieve logged position data
% To create the map, latitude, longitude, and speed data will be needed. 
% The |poslog| function can be used to retrieve this information from 
% |mobiledev|.

[lat, lon, t, spd] = poslog(m);

%%
% For this example, data has already been logged and saved.

load drivingAroundMathWorks lat lon spd;

%% Bin speeds into color values
% The speed values are binned in order to use a discrete number of colors 
% to represent the observed speeds.

nBins = 10;
binSpacing = (max(spd) - min(spd))/nBins; 
binRanges = min(spd):binSpacing:max(spd)-binSpacing; 

% Add an inf to binRanges to enclose the values above the last bin.
binRanges(end+1) = inf;

% |histc| determines which bin each speed value falls into.
[~, spdBins] = histc(spd, binRanges);

%% Split latitude and longitude data by speed
% A discontinuous line segment is created for every speed bin. Each of 
% these segments will be assigned a single color. This creates far fewer 
% total line segments than treating every adjacent pair of latitude and 
% longitude values as their own line segments. 
%
% The individual segments are stored as geographic features using
% |geoshape| from Mapping Toolbox.

lat = lat';
lon = lon';
spdBins = spdBins';

% Create a geographical shape vector, which stores the line segments as
% features.
s = geoshape();

for k = 1:nBins
    
    % Keep only the lat/lon values which match the current bin. Leave the 
    % rest as NaN, which are interpreted as breaks in the line segments.
    latValid = nan(1, length(lat));
    latValid(spdBins==k) = lat(spdBins==k);
    
    lonValid = nan(1, length(lon));
    lonValid(spdBins==k) = lon(spdBins==k);    

    % To make the path continuous despite being segmented into different
    % colors, the lat/lon values that occur after transitioning from the
    % current speed bin to another speed bin will need to be kept.
    transitions = [diff(spdBins) 0];
    insertionInd = find(spdBins==k & transitions~=0) + 1;

    % Preallocate space for and insert the extra lat/lon values.
    latSeg = zeros(1, length(latValid) + length(insertionInd));
    latSeg(insertionInd + (0:length(insertionInd)-1)) = lat(insertionInd);
    latSeg(~latSeg) = latValid;
    
    lonSeg = zeros(1, length(lonValid) + length(insertionInd));
    lonSeg(insertionInd + (0:length(insertionInd)-1)) = lon(insertionInd);
    lonSeg(~lonSeg) = lonValid;

    % Add the lat/lon segments to the geographic shape vector.
    s(k) = geoshape(latSeg, lonSeg);
    
end

%% Create a web map and route overlay
% The pieces can now be combined into a webmap display. The latitude and 
% longitude data have been processed to make up individual line segments to
% overlay on the map. Each line segment has a color corresponding to the 
% speed recorded at the respective position. 
%
% Mapping Toolbox provides a number of functions for working with web maps.
%
% Use |webmap| to open a web map in a browser.

wm = webmap('Open Street Map');

%%
% For reference, MathWorks is marked on the map.

mwLat = 42.299827;
mwLon = -71.350273;
name = 'MathWorks';
iconDir = fullfile(matlabroot,'toolbox','matlab','icons');
iconFilename = fullfile(iconDir, 'matlabicon.gif');
wmmarker(mwLat, mwLon, 'FeatureName', name, 'Icon', iconFilename);

%%
% A list of colors corresponding to the speed bins is generated using
% the |autumn| colormap. This creates an [nBins x 3] matrix with RGB values
% for each bin.

colors = autumn(nBins);

%%
% A line is drawn on the webmap using the geographic shape vector. Each
% element of the shape vector corresponds to a discontinuous line segment
% for a binned speed value. These elements match the elements of the color
% list that was just created.

wmline(s, 'Color', colors, 'Width', 5);

%%
% Zoom the map in on the route.

wmzoom(16);

%% 
% The final display provides a visual representation of location and speed
% throughout the route. The device was clearly traveling more slowly while
% in the parking lot and during turns than it was on straightaways. 

%% Clean up
% Turn off the position sensor and clear |mobiledev|.

m.PositionSensorEnabled = 0;
